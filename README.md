# Movie Mirage

## Description

**Movie Mirage** is a creative project where we stage, direct, act, and produce our own movie as a storybook. This storybook is produced in PDF format and consists of images and dialogues. The project involves using Python to turn photographs into drawings, stitching them together, and adding text overlays.

The storybook is produced in two languages: English and a regional language. The submission includes the storybook PDFs and the accompanying Python code used to generate them.

## Key Functionalities

- **Image Resizing:** Resizes images to fit properly in the document without overlaps or cut-offs.
- **Text Overlays:** Adds text overlays to images, ensuring they fit properly without overlaps.
- **Image Filters/Cartoonizing:** Applies cartoon effects to images using Python libraries.
- **PDF Generation:** Generates storybook PDFs in English and the regional language.

## Structure

- `Movie_Mirage.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for generating the storybook images.
- `MoviePoster.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for generating the movie poster.
- `movie_dialogues.csv`: CSV file containing the dialogues for the storybook.
- `images/`: Directory containing the original photographs.
- `output/`: Directory where the generated images and PDFs are saved.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries:
  - matplotlib
  - pillow
  - numpy
  - fpdf
  - opencv-python

## Conclusion
Movie Mirage is a testament to the fusion of creativity and technology. By leveraging Python's powerful libraries, we've transformed traditional storytelling into an innovative digital format. This project not only showcases our ability to adapt and use technical skills in a creative context but also highlights the potential for digital tools to revolutionize traditional media. We hope that our storybook will inspire others and serve as a prototype for future multimedia projects. Thank you for exploring our journey through the world of Movie Mirage.
